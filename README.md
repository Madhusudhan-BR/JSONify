# JSONify
#### Functional requirements 
[ ] The application should be able to fetch a list of all users from the endpoint: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
[ ] The application should be able to persist the list of all users to a local database.
[ ] The application should display the list of users from above.
The list should provide relevant/most important information of the above user.
[ ] The application user should be able to select one of the users from the list, and see all of the information related to that user.
[ ] For each user, add a different photo from the endpoint: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos
There is no need to handle all of the photos. Pick a specific album or a few of the photos.
Allow asynchronous loading and caching of the images.
